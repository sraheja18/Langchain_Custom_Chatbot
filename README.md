# Multiple-PDF-Chatbot

This Chatbot allows you to chat with multiple pdfs by simply uploading them. You can ask questions based on the content in the pdf and get answers using the knowledge of your PDFs. 

## Scope
Chat-GPT or other LLMs don't allow you to upload PDFs on their main website. Thus, they miss the context. Using a custom chatbot can allow you to get personalized answers.

## Tech Stack 
- Python
- Langchain
- Streamlit
